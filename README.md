# Creature Chess

An open-source auto chess game written in TypeScript using React and Node.

## Prerequesites

- You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm to run Creature Chess. The Node.js installer will install both of these - Node.js version 10 is recommended.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Running

When the game is running, you will be able to access it at localhost:8090 in your browser.

To run both the server and the client at the same time (recommended), you can use the command:

```shell
$ npm start
```

### Advanced

If you want to run the server or client individually, you can use these two commands

```shell
# run the server individually
$ npm run start:server

# run the client individually
$ npm run start:client
```

You can also run the server and client in development mode, where changes to the source code will result in the system restarting.

```shell
# run the server in dev mode
$ npm run dev:server

# run the client in dev mode
$ npm run dev:client
```
